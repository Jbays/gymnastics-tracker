# gymnastics-tracker

here I will create a full-stack app to help me track my gymnastics progress.

## For each gymnastics progression, I want to

1. View my progress over calendar time
2. Log sets, reps, and notes.
3. Receive recommendations when to graduate to next exercise set

What else?

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
